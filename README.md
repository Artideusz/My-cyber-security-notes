### Web Apps for pentesting practice

- [OWASP - Juice Shop (Docker version)](https://hub.docker.com/r/bkimminich/juice-shop)
    - This is a vulnerable web app that let's you try out different kinds of attacks, like XSS, SQL Injection, misconfiguration exploits and more! There are also tutorials that help in learning about various vulnerabilities.
- [Google Gruyere](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/)
    - Google Gruyere is a web application that helps you learn about the most common attacks that occur in the real world. It has a lot of vulnerabilities and is a nice playground to play around.
