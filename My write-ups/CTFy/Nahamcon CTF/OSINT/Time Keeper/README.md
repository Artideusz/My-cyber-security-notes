- ## First blog (desolate - 17.04.19)
    - The blog post consists of an image of R2D2 and C3PO with text `What a desolate place this is.` from Star Wars in ASCII format that is also an image. The image has a title attribute saying: `Donâ€™t call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!`
        - The image is named `churchmag.png`
        - The image does not contain any crucial information in it's metadata.

In the source of the page, we have comments in almost every blog post.
- ### BUZZ WORDS
    - Located in a p tag in the article tag `DevOps: A History in Configuration Management`
- ###  I fear that they may have just hit the 'move fast and break things' era that industry is finally realizing was a horrible idea. -- @peiriannydd
    - Located in a p tag in the article tag `Rookie of the Year`

Web.archive:

    - There is a new blog that has the following description: `Today, I created my first CTF challenge. The flag can be found at forward slash flag dot txt`
    - If we append /flag.txt to the current web.archive URL, we get the flag.
